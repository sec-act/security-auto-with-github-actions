in this file I am going to add challenges that are facing when improving these workflows

1. sometimes actions (docker images) are failed to fetch
    planned mitigation -try to keep it in local registries or have your own dockerhub registry
2. generally a job has multiple steps. for example a job has 3 steps,each step can be a scan that cab be a nuclei scan or gobuster scan. 
    if any step failed, we need to run the job again. what if a last step failed out of 10 steps
    planned mitigation - may be it is good to have only one step/task/scan for a job
3. when we run any job, it is taking more time to spin-up(running docker, setting up tools, loading packages from internet etc)
    planned mitigations - 
        1. build docker images with readily available binaries without downloading packages at runtime
            for example - A Dockerfile with nuclei binary, this way you can run nuclei scan when docker image initiation(No packaging required)
        2. maintain a local docker registry
